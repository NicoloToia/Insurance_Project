# Insurance_Project

This project, conducted by Group 06 of the Mathematical Engineering program for the 2023-2024 academic year, focuses on the analysis and modeling of the Solvency II framework. The project involves a detailed examination of both stochastic and deterministic approaches to calculating the Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR) and Best Estimate Liabilities (BEL). The work is supported by both MATLAB and Excel code, providing robust computational tools to simulate and analyze various risk scenarios and their impacts on the SCR and BEL components.
